# SQLGenius
> SQL Query Generator Using Large Language Model. Through a user-friendly web application, users input database schemas, feature specifications, and requirements in natural language. SQLGenius will generate the SQL query for developers and non-technical users to get insights from data. This automated process significantly accelerates query creation, benefiting both developers and non-technical users. The project has the potential to revolutionize database interaction, offering an efficient and accessible solution that bridges the gap between natural language and technical SQL code.
